namespace SWA {
// Very lightweight class for storing local variable
// references. There is no type or constness checking here -
// it is assumed that any one calling the getter or setter
// has meta data available which will tell them the type and
// readonly status of the variable. Consequently the
// reference to the variable is just stored as a void* of
// the variable's address. We could do some safety checks
// using type_info, but that would just add runtime
// overheads. We could also use the boost::any class, but
// again that is too heavyweight for what we need here, as
// we are not interested in storing values, just references
// to them. Consequently we would just be using it to store
// pointers, in which case it decomposes to what we have
// here (but with the type_info checking), but with lots of
// heap news and deletes which we don't need, because all
// pointers are the same size and can be stored in a void*.
